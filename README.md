# Repo for Centralized Architecture of Quantum Internet
## Abstract
The quantum internet is an advanced network that connects quantum systems. The research of architecture has tremendous significance in realizing quantum internet. Currently, studies focus on the distributed architecture, which relies on quantum repeaters to perform entanglement preparation & distribution, caused the critical problems: 1) vast costs of maintaining the entanglement preparing environment, 2) inefficient entanglement preparation & distribution, 3) non-optimal entanglement routing without considering the global network state, 4) lack of ability to perform time synchronization of quantum operations and action control of quantum devices. We propose a three-layer centralized quantum internet architecture to solve the problems above. At the top layer, we deploy the central controller to collect the global network state for optimal entanglement routing. Also, we can perform network management with the powerful ability of the central controller. At the middle layer, we design the local domain controller for entanglement preparation & distribution, reducing maintenance overhead and improving efficiency. At the bottom layer, quantum devices are responsible for executing quantum operations. In the experimental part, we evaluate the performance of centralized quantum internet architecture by using the discrete-event simulator for quantum networks
